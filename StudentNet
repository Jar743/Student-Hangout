16 y/o programmer, from Miami, Florida.
<p>
Taught myself how to code at Harvard.

Something about the atmosphere here, it just makes you want to reach and surpass your "full" capacity.
<p> 
Student Hangout is currently under beta and therefore only available to select students, for the time being.
<p> 
Currently available in Harvard network:
